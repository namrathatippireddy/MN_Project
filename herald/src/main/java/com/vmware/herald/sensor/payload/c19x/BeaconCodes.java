/**
 Beacon codes are derived from day codes. On each new day, the day code for the day, being a long value,
 is taken as 64-bit raw data. The bits are reversed and then hashed (SHA) to create a seed for the beacon
 codes for the day. It is cryptographically challenging to derive the day code from the seed, and it is this seed
 that will eventually be distributed by the central server for on-device matching. The generation of beacon
 codes is similar to that for day codes, it is based on recursive hashing and taking the modulo to produce
 a collection of long values, that are randomly selected as beacon codes. Given the process is deterministic,
 on-device matching is possible, once the beacon code seed is provided by the server.
