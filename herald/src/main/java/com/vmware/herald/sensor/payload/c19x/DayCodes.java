/**
 Day codes are derived from a shared secret that has been agreed with the central server on registration.
 Given a shared secret, a sequence of forward secure day codes is created by recursively hashing (SHA)
 the hash of the shared secret, and using the hashes in reverse order; a day code is generated by taking
 the first eight bytes of a hash as a long value code. It is cryptographically challenging to predict the next
 code given the previous codes. Each day is allocated a day code up to a finite number of days for simplicity.
